# W02D04 - Promises

### To Do

- [x] Illustrate the "callback waterfall" (callback hell) problem
- [x] Introduction to Promises
- [x] Error handling with Promises (vs callbacks)
- [x] Parallelizing async things (Promise.race and Promise.all)
- [x] Creating our own Promises (not super important)

## Promise

Pending
Fulfilled -> Then
Rejected -> Catch! (gotta catch them all!)
